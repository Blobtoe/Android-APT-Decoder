# Android-APT-Decoder (Work In Progress)
An APT Decoder that allows you to decoder weather satellites on your phone

## About
The decoder is written in python and can be found [here](https://github.com/Chemfinn/apitran-improved/tree/master/apitran-improved). I simply tweaked the code to work with chaquopy so I could build it into an app. The tweaked python file can be found [here](https://github.com/Blobtoe/Android-APT-Decoder/blob/master/app/src/main/python/app.py).

## Installing
You can find the apk file in [/apk/](https://github.com/Blobtoe/Android-APT-Decoder/blob/master/apk/APT%20Decoder.apk). I plan on releasing it to the play store eventually.

# To do:
  - Add parameters for sharpening and stuff
  - Fix resmapling on certain files
  - ~Implement zoom on images~
  - Allow user to pick specific folder to save images
  - Add error messages
  - ~Add decoding log~
