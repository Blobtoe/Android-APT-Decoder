# Android-APT-Decoder (Work In Progress)
An APT Decoder that allows you to decoder weather satellites on your phone

## About
The decoder is written in python and can be found [here](https://github.com/Chemfinn/apitran-improved/tree/master/apitran-improved). I simply tweaked the code to work with chaquopy so I could build it into an app.

Currently, the app will only run for 5 minutes because it is running on an unlisenced copy of chaquopy, but I am currently in the process of aquiring one.

## Installing
You can find the apk file in /apk/. I plan on releasing it to the play store soon.
